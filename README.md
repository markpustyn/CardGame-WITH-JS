# CardGame WITH JS
 JavaScript Blackjack Card Game

This is a basic JavaScript-based card game that is based on Blackjack. The game allows users to interact with a web application and includes HTML and CSS for a visually appealing experience.
Getting Started

To get started with the game, you can either download or clone the repository to your local machine. Once downloaded, open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to start playing the game.
Rules of the Game

The game is based on the traditional Blackjack rules, where the goal is to get a hand value of 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over. The game is played with a standard 52-card deck, where the face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) are worth 10 points, the Ace can be worth 1 or 11 points, and all other cards are worth their face value.

To start the game, the player is dealt two cards face up, and the dealer is dealt two cards with one card face up and one card face down. The player can then choose to hit (receive another card) or stand (keep their current hand). The player can continue to hit until they are satisfied with their hand or until they bust (their hand value goes over 21). Once the player stands, the dealer reveals their face-down card and hits until their hand value is at least 17. If the dealer busts or has a lower hand value than the player, the player wins. If the player busts or has a lower hand value than the dealer, the dealer wins. In the case of a tie, the game is a push and the player receives their bet back.
Integrating with the Web Application

This card game can be easily integrated into your web application by linking to the necessary JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files. You can customize the look and feel of the game by modifying the CSS file. You can also modify the game logic in the JavaScript file to change the rules or add additional features.
